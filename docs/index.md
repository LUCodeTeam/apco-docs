This is a test.

![image](test.png)

This is the landing page (which becomes index.html).

The folders notes and labs are just to keep content separate.

The website structure is defined by the first few lines of each file between the "---" (folders are ignored).

- layout: home for index.html (this one) or page or default
- nav_order: order in navigation menu to the left of the page
- parent: for child doc name of the parent
- has_children: true or false
- use_mathjax: equations are rendered using mathjax if their are equations on the page then this should be set to true.
